## 10. Recommendations

### Cost Optimization Strategies
1. **Reserved Instances**: Commit to 3-year terms for 40% savings
2. **Spot Instances**: Use for development/testing (70% savings)
3. **Auto-scaling**: Right-size resources based on actual usage
4. **S3 Intelligent Tiering**: Automatic cost optimization for storage
5. **Scheduled Scaling**: Reduce non-production resources after hours

### Phased Implementation Approach
1. **Phase 1** (Months 1-3): Migrate Dev/SIT environments
2. **Phase 2** (Months 4-6): Migrate UAT, establish DR
3. **Phase 3** (Months 7-9): Production migration
4. **Phase 4** (Months 10-12): Optimization and automation

### Risk Mitigation
- Maintain on-premise backup for first 6 months
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Regular disaster recovery drills (quarterly)
- Multi-region backup strategy
- 24/7 support coverage with defined SLAs
